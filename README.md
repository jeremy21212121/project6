#Quotes on Dev

The goal of this project was to build the required functionality using WordPress, AngularJS and the WP REST API. This is the first project I have built that combines both Angular and WordPress.

This site has two major featues: It displays a quote from the database on the main page, and it accepts submission of new quotes into the database from the "Submit" page.

The most interesting part of this project, for me, was working with the WordPress REST API. It makes the front-end of WordPress optional, which opens up a lot of possibilities. It will be interesting to see how this technology evolves!
